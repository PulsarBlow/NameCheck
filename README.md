# NameCheck

NameCheck is simple web API providing features to check for a **name availability on WHOIS and social networks**.
It helps choosing a name for your new project. A name which is available and ready to be used.

There are other better, more complete, more polished tools existing on the web (eg: [namechk.com](http://namechk.com/))

However for a contiguous project ([Project Igniter](https://github.com/PulsarBlow/projectigniter)) i needed this kind of features as a web api.
I didn't find any free one matching my needs, so here comes this project.

The API is hosted at https://namecheck.azurewebsites.net
