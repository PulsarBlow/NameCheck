# NameCheck

NameCheck is simple web API providing features to check for a name availability on WHOIS and social networks.
It helps choosing a name for your new project. A name which is available and ready to be used.

There are other better, more complete, more polished tools existing on the web (eg: [http://namechk.com/](namechk.com))

However for a contiguous project ([https://github.com/PulsarBlow/projectigniter](ProjectIgniter)) i needed this kind of features as a web api.
I didn't find any free one matching my needs, so here comes this project.

The API is hosted at https://namecheck.azurewebsites.net
